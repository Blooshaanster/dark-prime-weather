#Branches and Tags
You can create and checkout branches directly within VS code through the Git: Create Branch and Git: Checkout to commands in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

If you run Git: Checkout to, you will see a drop-down list containing all of the branches or tags in the current repository.

Git checkout

The Git: Create Branch command lets you quickly create a new branch. Just provide the name of your new branch and VS Code will create the branch and switch to it.
